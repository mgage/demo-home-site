These demonstration courses allow anyone to login and act as an instructor. Use `login: profa` and `password: profa`. Since anyone can use these courses do not create anything that you want
saved over the long term.  

The LibraryBrowser link gives you access to the OpenProblemLibrary so that you can explore the range of existing problems.

You can view the course as a student using the `guest login` button.
