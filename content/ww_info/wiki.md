The wiki is the main source for information. There is a lot of information on this site although unfortunately it is no always easy to find.  There are two search options in the upper left hand corner of the main page and google search is also effective.

You need to register on the wiki in order to be able to post messages to the forums. The registration is approved by hand so it might take a day or two for the response.  

If the captcha feature for registering won't work with your browser/platform email gage at math.rochester.edu with the user name you would like to register with.
