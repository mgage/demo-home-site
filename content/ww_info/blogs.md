There is a [blog accumulator](http://webwork.maa.org/planet) for WeBWorK community posts about WeBWorK.
These often present features of WeBWorK.  Much of the material is also on the wiki, but the blog posts are organized in a more conversational manner. 

Of particular interests are the posts from [Goeff Goehle](http://webworkgoehle.blogspot.com/)  and from [Mike Gage](http://michaelgage.blogspot.com/)
