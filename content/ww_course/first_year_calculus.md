At the University of Rochester there are two standard tracks (MTH140 series and MTH160 series) for calculus (plus an honors series track: MTH171-4). The two standard tracks typically use Stewart's calculus text.

The MTH161, MTH162 series covers traditional differential and integral calculus in two semesters.  This is the standard course taken by engineers and many mathematics and physics students.

The MTH141, MTH142, MTH143 series covers traditional differential and integral calculus in three semesters.  It covers essentially the same material as the MTH160 series but at a slower pace.  It is taken by those less confident about their mathematics preparation or who require less mathematics background for their major.
